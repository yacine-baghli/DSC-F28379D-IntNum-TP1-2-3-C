## Introduction

The practical sessions covered in this repository are designed to enhance the understanding and implementation of PWM and ADC in embedded systems, focusing on motor control applications. The sessions included configuring PWM signals, integrating ADC for real-time data acquisition, and implementing current regulation using a DSC.

## Lab-1: PWM Configuration

- **Objective**: Configure PWM and its timer, observe and analyze PWM signals, modify polarity, and adjust duty cycle.
- **Tasks**:
  - PWM configuration and timer setup.
  - Observation and analysis of PWM signals using an oscilloscope.
  - Modification of signal polarity and duty cycle.

## Lab-2: PWM and ADC Integration

- **Objective**: Integrate PWM with ADC to read voltage values and adjust the PWM duty cycle based on ADC readings.
- **Tasks**:
  - Code to configure ADC and read voltage values.
  - Synchronize ADC conversions with PWM.
  - Analyze conversion results and adjust duty cycle based on ADC values.

## Lab-3: Current Regulation on DSC

- **Objective**: Implement digital current regulation using PWM and ADC, observe signals, and adjust regulation parameters.
- **Tasks**:
  - Implement PWM and ADC for current regulation.
  - Observe signals on an oscilloscope and adjust regulation parameters.
  - Implement Proportional-Integral (PI) control for current regulation in an inductive load.

## Conclusion

These practical sessions have significantly enhanced the theoretical and practical knowledge necessary for the subsequent stages of the internship. Key concepts such as open and closed loops, PI controllers, state feedback correction, digital control, and first and second-order systems were reinforced. Practical skills in using ADC, PWM (both single and three-phase), and four-quadrant choppers were developed. Additionally, programming skills in C were applied, particularly for DSP board programming, managing internal clocks, and handling interrupts.
